**Question 1**

**(34 marks)**

**Create a console app that interacts with an
API of your choice, gets some data out of it and does a meaningful
transformation. **You can pick one of the suggested APIs
which are free and beginner-friendly, this will not impact creativity points.
Make sure your API is free to use and do not share your private access key.

Remember to come up with a unique creative
problem or scenario!

Marks:

1. 5 points for creativity
2. 4 points for commenting, variable naming, and code formatting
3. 25points for meeting the
   requirements (coding concepts taught and their use)

You should:

+ Use **boolean**
  values and **if..else** statements to
  branch logic of your program
+ Use a **data structure** like a list, dictionary, set or tuple to store values
+ Use a for **loop or a while loop** toreduce repetition
+ Use **functionswith returns** to make code reusable
+ Use string slicing
+ Use at least two inbuilt functions
+ Use any free API to get some information as json. In code, explain how your
  instructor can set up any necessary API keys and briefly how you are using the
  API
+ **Import an additional module** and use it. If it
  needs to be installed, explain how to do that in the comments, and briefly note
  what it is for.
+ Write your final results **in a file**

Each of the above-mentioned requirements is worth** 2-3 points.**  The use of API
is worth 7 points.


Joke of the Day

This app is aimed to give the user one joke each day to make them smile.

I have taken the jokes from https://v2.jokeapi.dev/ api.

I have displayed the jokes that have been generated in a txt file and in a dictionary which I have saved in a separate dictionary file.  I have used the dictionary file to search to see if the user has already received a joke that day.

For future developments you could take the data from the dictionary file and ask the user if they would like to hear a joke from a previous day.  This would have been a nice extra that I have not had time to implement.

This app does not need an api key.
